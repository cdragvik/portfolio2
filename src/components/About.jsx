      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Christiane Nanette Dragvik, and I'm a passionate 25-year-old vernepleier (caregiver) currently pursuing my frontend development studies at Noroff alongside my work in home care. While working in the healthcare sector, I've witnessed the growing impact of cutting-edge welfare technology on our daily routines, sparking my interest in technology and development.
        As a social educator, I've honed my strong work ethic and attention to detail, solving complex problems with precision in an ever-changing environment. My experience has taught me the value of collaboration and effective communication, vital skills I believe will be instrumental in the tech industry when conveying technological innovations to clients and stakeholders.
        My comprehensive frontend development education at Noroff has equipped me with a diverse skill set in web development. With proficiency in tools such as Adobe XD, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, and GitHub, I'm well-versed in designing, developing, testing, debugging, and distributing interactive web solutions. I have a keen eye for project planning, responsive design, accessibility, performance, user interfaces, and user experience, ensuring I deliver user-friendly and visually appealing projects.
        I'm excited to take the next step in my career and transition into the role of a frontend developer. Embracing new challenges and continuous learning opportunities, I'm eager to stay up-to-date with industry trends and best practices to create the best solutions for your users.
        Let's build something amazing together!</p>
